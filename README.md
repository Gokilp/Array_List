# Array_List

This is a C++ program that allows the user to perform various operations on an integer array through a menu-driven interface. The program allows the user to insert values at the end of the array, insert values at a specified position, delete values at a specified position, display the array contents, and exit the program. The program starts by declaring and initializing the Size variable to 0 and the arr array to a maximum size of 100. The program also defines functions to display, insert at a specified position, and delete at a specified position. The main function contains an infinite loop that displays the menu options to the user and prompts for their choice. 

The program can be used as an example of how to implement a menu-driven interface in C++ to manipulate an array.
